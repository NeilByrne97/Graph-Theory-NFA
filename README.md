Problem - "Write a program in Python that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text"

The problem was broken down into four steps:
  1. Parse the regular expression from infix to postfix notation.
  2. Build a series of small NFA's for parts of the regular expression.
  3. Use the smaller NFA's to create the pverall NFA.
  4. Implement the matching algorithm using the NFA.
  
  --Running the Program--
  1. Clone or copy the python script.
  2. Unzip the file if needed.
  3. Through the command line navigate to the project file "Graph Theory".
  4. Run the script with the command "python NFA.py".
